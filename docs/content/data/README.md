# Datasets

This section includes all the datasets used in the book. Each of them are introduced, with appropriate provenance links. Where available, we are also including reproducible narrative that shows you how we built the final datasets used in the book and provide links to individual files. 

**DISCLAIMER**: this is *not* part of the official book. Rather you should think of it as an "online extra". Each notebook does not have the depth, detail and pedagogy we strive for in the book chapters. Yet, we believe the code presented in these sections may be useful for some and hence we make it available.

Happy hacking!
