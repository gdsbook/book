# H3 grid

This dataset contains a hexagonal tesselation following Uber's H3 system that covers the core of San Diego. 

The delineation of the city centre is somewhat arbitrary, was manually drawn using [`geojson.io`](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0), and is stored in `sd_city_centre.geojson` in this folder.
