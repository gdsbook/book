<p>This chapter provides an overview of the scientific and computational context
in which the book is framed. First, we will explore debates around Open
Science, its origins, and how the computational community is responding to
these. In particular, we will discuss computational notebooks, open-source
packages, and reproducible platforms. Having covered the conceptual
background, we will turn to a practical introduction of the key infrastructure
that makes up this book: Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab, Python packages,
and a containerised platform to run the book.</p>

<h2>Open Science<a class="headerlink" href="#open-science" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The term Open Science has grown in popularity in recent years. Although it is
used in a variety of contexts with slightly different meanings, a general
sense of the intuition behind Open Science is the understanding that the
scientific process, at its core, is meant to be transparent and accessible.
In this context, the focus on openess is not to be seen as an “add-on” that
changes the general approach only cosmetically, but as a key component of what
makes science Science. Indeed the scientific process, understood as one where
we “build on the shoulders of Giants” and progress through dialectic, can only
work properly is there is enough transparency and accessibility that the
community can access and study both results <em>and</em> the process that created
them.</p>
<p>To better understand the argument behind modern Open Science, it is useful
to take a historical perspective. The idea of openness was engrained at the
core of early scientists. In fact that was one of the key differentials with
their contemporary “alchemists” which, in many respects, were working on
similar topics albeit in a much more opaque way <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id32"><span>Nie20</span></a>]</span>. Scientists
would record the field or lab experiments on paper notebooks or diaries,
providing enough detail to, first, remember what they had done and how they
had arrived at their results, but also to ensure other members of the
scientific community could study, understand, and replicate their findings.
One of the most famous of these annotations are Galileo’s drawings of Jupiter (<a class="reference external" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Medicean_Stars.png">source</a>) and the Medicean stars:</p>

<p>There is a growing perception that much of the original ethos of Science to
operate through transparency and accessibility has been lost. A series of
recent big profile scandals have even prompted some to call it a state of
crisis <span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id25"><span>Ioa07</span></a>]</span>. This “crisis” arises because the analyses that scientists conduct
are difficult to repeat, let alone understand. Both article length and publication
volume has grown immensely since the early days of science, and this has
affected our ability to understand our literature as a whole.</p>
<p>Why is there a sense that Science is no longer open and
transparent in the way Galileo’s diaries were? Although certinaly not the only
or even the most important one, technology plays a role. The process and workflow
of original scientists relied on a set of “analog” technologies for which an
“analog” parallel set of tools was developed to keep track and document
progress. Hence the paper notebooks where biologists drew species, or chemists
painstakingly detailed each step they took in the lab. In the case of social
sciences, this was probably easier in the sense that quantitative data was not
abundant and much of the analysis relied either on math or small datasets
which could be directly documented in the original publications.</p>
<p>However Science has evolved a great deal since then, and much of the
experimental workflow is dominated by a variety of machinery, most
prominently by computers. Most of the Science done today, at some
point in the process, takes the form of operations mediated through software
programs. In this context, the traditional approach of writing down in a paper
notebook every step followed becomes dislocated from the medium in which most of
the scientific work takes place.</p>
<p>The current state of Science in terms of transparency and openness is prompting
for action <span id="id3">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id34"><span>Rey09</span></a>]</span>. On the back of these debates, the term
“reproducibility” is also gaining traction. Again, this is a rather general
term but, in one variant or another, its definition alludes to the need of
scientific results to be accompanied by enough information and detail so they
could be repeated by a third party. Since much of modern science is mediated
through computers, reproducibility thus poses important challenges for the
tools and practices the scientific community builds and relies on. Although
there is a variety of approaches, in this book we focus on what we see as the
emerging consensus. This framework enables to record and express entire
workflows in a way that is both transparent and that fosters efficiency and
collaboration.</p>
<p>We structure our approach to reproducibility in three main layers that build on
each other. At the top of this “stack” are <em>computational notebooks</em>; supporting
the code written in notebooks are <em>open source packages</em>; and making possible to
transfer computations across different hardware devices and/or architectures
are what we term <em>reproducible platforms</em>. Let us delve into each of them with
a bit more detail before we practically show how this book is built on this
infrastructure (and how you too can reproduce it at home!).</p>
<div class="section" id="computational-notebooks">
<h3>Computational notebooks<a class="headerlink" href="#computational-notebooks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Computational notebooks are the XXIst Century sibling of Galileo’s notebooks.
Like their predecessors, they allow researchers, (data) scientists, and
computational practitioners to record their practices and steps taken as they
are going about their work; unlike the pen and paper approach, computational
notebooks are fully integrated in the technological paradigm in which research
and computation takes place today. For these reasons, they are rapidly becoming the
modern-day version of the traditional academic paper, the main vehicle on
which (computational) knowledge is created, shared, and consumed.
Computational notebooks (or notebooks, from now on) are also spreading their
reach into industry practices, being used, for example, in reports.</p>
<p>All implementations of notebooks share a series of
core features. First, a notebook comprises a single file that stores narrative text,
computer code, and the output produced by code. Storing both
narrative and computational work in a <em>single file</em> means that the entire
workflow can be recorded and documented in the same place, without having to
resort to ancillary devices (like a paper notebook). A second feature of
notebooks is that they allow for <em>interactive work</em>. Modern computational work
benefits from the ability to try, fail, tinker, and iterate quickly until a
working solution is found. Notebooks embody this quality and enable the user
to work interactively. Whether the computation takes place on a laptop or
on a data center, notebooks provide the same interface for interactive
computing, lowering the cognitive load require to scale up. Third, notebooks
have <em>interoperability</em> built in. The notebook format is designed for
recording and sharing computational work, but not necessarily for other stages
of the research cycle. To widen the range of possibilities and
applications, notebooks are designed to be easily convertible into other
formats. For example, while a specific application is required to open and edit
most notebook file formats, no additional software is required to convert them
into pdf files that can be read, printed, and annotated without the need of technical
software.</p>
<p>Notebooks represent the top layer on the reproducibility stack. They can capture
in detailed and reproducible ways work that is specific about a given project:
what data is used, how it is read, cleaned, and transformed; what algorithms are used, how they
are combined; how each figure in the project is generated, etc. Guidance on how
to write notebooks in efficient ways is also emerging (e.g. <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id40"><span>RBZ+19</span></a>]</span>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="open-source-packages">
<h3>Open source packages<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source-packages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To make notebooks an efficient medium to communicate computational work, it is
important that they are concise and streamlined. One way to achieve this goal is
to only include the parts of the work that are unique to the application being
recorded in the notebook, and to avoid duplication. From this it follows that
if a piece of code is used several times across the notebook, or even across
several notebooks, that functionality should probably be taken out of the
notebook and into a centralised place where it can be accessed whenever
needed. In other words, such functionality should be turned into a package.</p>
<p>Packages are modular, flexible and repurposable compilations of code. Unlike
notebooks, they do not capture specific applications but abstractions of
functionality that can be used in a variety of contexts. Their function is to
avoid duplication “downstream” by encapsulating functionality in a way that
can be accessed and used in a variety of contexts without having to re-write
code every time it is needed. In doing so, packages (or libraries, an
interchangeable term in this context) embody the famous hacker moto of D.R.Y.:
“don’t repeat yourself”.</p>
<p>Open source packages are packages whose code is available to inspect, modify
and redistribute. They fulfill the same functions as any package in terms of
modularising code, but they also enable transparency as any user can
access the exposed functionality <em>and</em> the underlying code that
generates it. For this reason, for code packages to serve Open Science and
reproducibility, they need to be open source.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reproducible-platforms">
<h3>Reproducible platforms<a class="headerlink" href="#reproducible-platforms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For computational work to be fully reproducible and open, it needs to be
possible to replicate in a different (computational) environment than where it
was originally created. This means that it is not sufficient to specify in a
notebook the code that creates the final outputs, and to rely on open source
packages for more general functionality; the environment specified by those
two components needs to be reproducible too. This statement, which might seem
obvious and straightforward, is not always so due to the scale and complexity
of modern computational workflows and infrastructures. The old saying of “if
it works on my laptop, what’s the problem?” is not enough any more, it needs
to work on “any laptop” (or computer).</p>
<p>Reproducible platforms encompass the more general aspects
that enable open source packages and notebooks to be reproducible. A
reproducible platform thus specifies the infrastructure required to ensure a
notebook that uses certain open source packages can be successfully executed.
Infrastructure, in this context, relates to lower-level aspects of the
software stack, such as the operating system, and even some hardware
requirements, such as the use of specific chips such as graphics processing
units (GPU). Additionally, a reproducible platform will also specify the
versions of packages that are required to recreate the results presented in a
notebook.</p>
<p>Unlike open source packages, the notion of reproducible platforms is not as
widespread and generally agreed upon. Its necessity has only become apparent more
recently, and work on providing them in standardised ways is less developed
than in the case of notebook technology or code packaging and distribution.
Nevertheless, some inroads are being made. One area which has experienced
significant progress in recent years and holds great promise in this context is
container technology. Containers are a lightweight version of a virtual
machine, which is a program that enables an entire operating system to run
compartimentalised on top of another operating system. Containers allow to
encapsulate an entire environment (or platform) in a format that is easy to
transfer and reproduce in a variety of computational contexts. The most
popular technology for containers nowadays is Docker, and the opportunities
that it provides to build transparent and transferrable infrastructure for
data science are starting to be explored <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id13"><span>Coo17</span></a>]</span>.</p>

<h4>Notebooks<a class="headerlink" href="#notebooks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This book uses notebooks as the main format in which its content is created and
distributed. Each chapter is written as a separate notebook and can
be run interactively. At the same time, we collect all chapters and convert
them into different formats for “static consumption” (ie. read only), either
in HTML format for the web, or PDF to be printed in a physical copy.
This section will present the specific format of notebooks we use, and
illustrate its building blocks in a way that allows you to then follow the
rest of the book interactively.</p>
<p>Our choice of notebook is Jupyter <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id29"><span>KRKPerez+16</span></a>]</span>. A Jupyter notebook is a plain
text file with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.ipynb</span></code> extension, which means that it is an easy file to
move around, sync, and track over time. Internally, it is structured as a plain-text document containing
JavaScript Object Notation that records the state of the notebook, so they
also integrate well with a host of modern web technologies.
The atomic element that makes up a notebook is called a <em>cell</em>. Cells are
consistent chunks of content that contain either text or code. In fact, a
notebook can be thought of as an ordered collection of cells. Cells can be of
two types: <em>text</em> and <em>code</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cells">
<h4>Cells<a class="headerlink" href="#cells" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Text cells contain text written in the Markdown markup language. Markdown is a
popular set of rules to create rich content (e.g. headers, lists, links) from
flat, plain text files without being as complex and sophisticated as other
typesetting approaches. The notebook will then render markdown
automatically. For more demanding or specific tasks, text cells can further
integrate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\LaTeX\)</span> notation. This means we can write most forms of narrative
relying on markdown, which is more straightforward, and rely on <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\LaTeX\)</span> for
more sophisticated parts, such as equations. Covering Markdown rules in detail
is beyond the scope of this chapter, but the interested reader can inspect the
<a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax">official Github specification</a>
of the so-called Github-flavored markdown, the one adopted by the notebook.</p>
<p>Code cells are text boxes that contain computer code. In the case of this
book, all code will be Python, but Jupyter notebooks are flexible enough to
work with other languages (see the offical list of Jupyter-supported kernels
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels">here</a>).
Aesthetically, code cells look as follows:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># This is a code cell</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A code cell can be run to execute the code it contains. If such code produces
an output (e.g. a table or a figure), this will be printed as a cell output.
Every time a cell is run, its counter will go up once.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rich-content">
<h4>Rich Content<a class="headerlink" href="#rich-content" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Code cells in a notebook also enable the embedding of rich (web) content. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">IPython</span></code> package provides methods to access as series of media and bring them
directly to the notebook environment. Let us see how this can be done
practically. To be able to demonstrate it, we will need to <em>import</em> the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">display</span></code> module (skip to the next section if you want to learn more about
importing packages):</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This makes available additional functionality that allows us to embed rich
content. For example, we can include a YouTube clip by passing the video ID:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">display</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">YouTubeVideo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;iinQDhsdE9s&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iinQDhsdE9s"
    frameborder="0"
    allowfullscreen
></iframe>
</div></div>
</div>
<p>Or we can pass standard HTML code:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">display</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">HTML</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;table&gt;</span>

<span class="s2">&lt;th&gt;Header 2&lt;/th&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;td&gt;row 1, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;td&gt;row 1, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;tr&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;td&gt;row 2, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;td&gt;row 2, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;/tr&gt;</span>
<span class="s2">&lt;/table&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell_output docutils container">
<div class="output text_html"><table>

<p>Note that this opens the door for including a large number of elements from the
web, since an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iframe</span></code> of any other website can also be included. Of more relevance
for this book, for example, we can embed interactive maps with an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">iframe</span></code>:</p>

<div class="section" id="jupyter-lab">
<h4>Jupyter Lab<a class="headerlink" href="#jupyter-lab" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Our recommended way to interact with Jupyter notebooks is through Jupyter Lab.
Jupyter Lab is an interface to the Jupyter ecosystem that brings together
several tools for data science into a consistent interface that enables the user
to accomplish most of her workflows. It is built as a web app following a
client-server architechture. This means the computation is decoupled from the
interface. This decoupling allows each to be hosted in the most convenient and
efficient solution. For example, you might be following this book
interactively in your laptop. In this case, it is likely both the server that
runs all the Python computations you specify in code cells (what we call the
<em>kernel</em>) is running locally, and you are interacting with it through your
browser of preference. But the same technology could power a situation where
your kernel is running in a cloud data center, and you interact with Jupyter
Lab from a tablet.</p>
<p>Jupyter Lab’ interface has three main areas:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">

</div>
</div>
<p>At the top we find a menu bar (red box in the figure) that allows us to open,
create and interact with files, as well as to modify the appearance and
behaviour of Jupyter Lab. The largest real estate is occupied by the main
pane (blue box). By default, there is an option to create a new notebook, open
a console, a terminal session, a (markdown) text file, and a window for
contextual help. Jupyter Lab provides a flexible workspace in that the user
can open as many windows as needed and rearrange them as desired by dragging
and dropping. Finally, on the left of the main pane we find the side pane
(green box),
which has several tabs that toggle on and off different auxilliary information.
By default, we find a file browser based on the folder from where the session
has been launched. But we can also switch to a pane that lists all the
currently open kernels and terminal sessions, a list of all the commands in the
menu (the command <em>palette</em>), and a list of all the open windows inside the
lab.</p>

<h4>Python<a class="headerlink" href="#python" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The main component of this book relies on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>
programming language. Python is a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language">high-
level</a>
programming language used widely in data science. To give a couple of examples of its
relevance, it powers <a class="reference external" href="https://www.quora.com/How-does-dropbox-use-python-What-features-are-implemented-in-it-any-tangentially-related-material?share=1">most of the company Dropbox’s main product</a>, and is also heavily
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/about/success/usa/">used</a> to control satellites at NASA.
A great deal of Science is also done in Python, from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLuIB8aW2KA">research in
astronomy</a> at UC Berkley, to
<a class="reference external" href="https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/">courses in economics</a> by Nobel Prize-winning professors.</p>
<p>This book uses Python because it is a good language for beginners and
high performance science alike. For this reason, it has emerged as one of the main
and most solid options for Data Science. Python is widely used for data
processing and analysis both in academia and in industry. There is a vibrant and
growing scientific community (through the <a class="reference external" href="http://scipy.org/">Scientific Python</a>
library and the <a class="reference external" href="http://pydata.org/">PyData</a> organization), working in
both universities and companies, to support and enhance the Python’s capabilities.
New methods and usability improvements of existing packages (also known as libraries)
are continuously being released. In geocomputation, Python is also very widely
adopted: it is the language used for scripting in both the main proprietary enterprise
geographic information system,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis">ArcGIS</a>,
and the leading open geographic information system, <a class="reference external" href="http://qgis.org">QGIS</a>. All
of this means that, whether you are thinking of continuing in Higher Education
or trying to find a job in industry, Python will be an important asset, valuable to
employers and scientists alike.</p>
<p>Python code is “dynamically interpreted”, which means it is run on-the-fly without
needing to be compiled. This is in contrast to other kinds of programming
languages, which require an additional non-interactive step where a program is
converted into a binary file, which is then run directly. With Python, one does
not need to worry about this non-interactive compilation step. Instead, we can
simply write code, run code, fix any issues directly, and then re-run the code in a
quick cycle. This makes Python a very productive tool for science, since you can
prototype code quickly and directly.</p>

<p>The standard Python language includes some data structures (such as lists and

products). For example, right out of the box, and without any further

<p>However, the strength of Python as a data analysis tool comes from additional
packages, software that adds functionality to the language itself.
In this book, we will introduce and use many of the core libraries of the “PyData stack”,
a set of heavily-used libraries that make Python a fully-fledged
system for (Geographic) Data Science. We will introduce each package as we use them
throughout the chapters. For now, we will show how an installed package can be
loaded into a session so its functionality can be accessed. This loading of
a package, in Python, is called <em>importing</em>. We will use the library <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">geopandas</span></code> as
an example. The simplest way to import a library is by typing the following:</p>

<p>We now have access to the entire library of methods and clases, which we
can call by prepending <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">geopandas.</span></code> to the name of the function we want.
Sometimes, however, we will want to shorten the name to save keystrokes. This
approach, called <em>aliasing</em>, can be done as follows:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">geopandas</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">gpd</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, every time we want to access a function from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">geopandas</span></code>, all we need to
type before the function’s name is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gpd.</span></code>. However sometimes we rather import
only parts of a library. For example, we might only want to use one function.
In this case, it might be cleaner and more efficient to bring the function
itself only:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">geopandas</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">read_file</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This allows us to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read_file</span></code> directly in the current session.</p>
<p>A very handy feature of Python is the ability to access on-the-spot help for functions.
This means that you can check what a function is supposed to do, or how to use it
from directly inside your Python session. Of course, this
also works handsomely inside a notebook, too. There are a couple of ways to access
the help.</p>
<p>Take the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read_file</span></code> function we have imported above. One way to check its help
dialog from within the notebook is to add a question mark after it:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">

<h3>Containerised platform<a class="headerlink" href="#containerised-platform" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned <a class="reference external" href="#Reproducible-platforms">earlier in this chapter</a>,
reproducible platforms encompass technology and practices that help
reproduce a set of analyses or computational work in a different environment
than that in which it was produced. There are several approaches to implement
this concept in a practical setting. For this book, we use a package called
Docker. Docker is based on an obscure feature of Linux called containers,
which allows to run processes in an isolated way within the operating system.
We decided to settle on Docker for several reasons but, in particular, for
three main reasons: first, it is widely adopted as an industry standard (e.g.
almost any website today runs on Docker containers), which means it is well
supported and is not likely to disappear any time soon; second, it has also
become a standard in the world of data science, which means foundational
projects such as Jupyter create official containers for these packages; and
third, because of the two previous reasons, building the platform that
supports the book in Docker allows us to easily integrate it, for example, in
the cloud or local servers, which in turn has benefits to
easily and efficiently make the book available in more contexts.</p>
<p>Docker allows us to create a “container” that includes all the tools required
to access the content of the book interactively. But, what exactly is a
container? There are several ways to describe it, from very technical
to more intuitive ones. In this context, we will focus on a general
understanding rather than on the technical details behind its magic. One can
think of a container as, well, a “box” that includes
<em>everything</em> that is required to run a certain set of software. This box can
be moved around, from machine to machine, and the computations it
executes will remain exactly the same. In fact, the content of the box
remains exactly the same, bit by bit. When we download a container into a
computer, be it a laptop or a data center, we are not performing an install of
the software it contains from the usual channels, for the platform on which we
are going to run it on. Instead, we are downloading the software in the form
that was installed when the container was originally built and packaged,
and for the operating system that was also packaged originally. This is the real
advantage: build once, run everywhere. For the experienced reader,
this might sound very much like their older syster: virtual machines. Although
there are similarities between both technologies, containers are more
lightweight and can be run much more swiftly than virtual machines.
This box that is isolated interacts with the rest of the computer through
several links that connect the two. In the case of this book, since JupyterLab
is a client-server application, the server runs inside the container and we
connect to it through two main “doors”: one, through the browser, we will
access the main Lab interface; and two, we will “mount” a folder inside the
container so we can use software inside the container to edit files that are
stored outside in the host machine.</p>
<p>“Containers are great but, how can I install and run one?”, you might be
asking yourself at this point. First, you will need to install Docker on your
machine. This assumes you have administrative rights (ie. you can install
software). If that is the case, you can go to the Docker website
([<a class="reference external" href="https://www.docker.com/">https://www.docker.com/</a>])(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.docker.com/">https://www.docker.com/</a>)) and install the version
that suits your operating system. Note that, although container
technology is Linux-based, Docker provides tools to run it smoothly in macOS
and Windows. An install guide for Docker is beyond the scope of this chapter,
but there is much documentation available on the web to this end. We
personally recommend the official documentation
(<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.docker.com/">https://docs.docker.com/</a>), but you might find other
resources that suit your needs better.</p>
<div class="section" id="run-the-book-s-container">
<h4>Run the book’s container<a class="headerlink" href="#run-the-book-s-container" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Once you have Docker up and running on your computer, you can download the
image we have prepared for the book. This operation is akin to installing the
software you need to interact with the book, so you will only need to run it once.
However, keep in mind that the image is relatively large (around 7GB), so you
will need the space on your machine as well as a good internet connection. If
you check those two boxes, you are ready to go. Here are the steps to take:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open a terminal or shell. How to do this will depend on your operating
system:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Windows</span></code>: we recommend PowerShell. Type “PowerShell” on the startup menu
and, when it comes up, hit enter. This will open a terminal for you.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">macOS</span></code>: use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Teminal.app</span></code>. You can find it on the Applications
folder, within the Utilities subfolder.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Linux</span></code>: if you are running Linux, you probably already have a terminal
application of preference. Almost any Linux distribution comes with a
terminal or shell app built in.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Download, or “pull”, our container. For this run on the terminal the
following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>docker pull gdsbook/stack
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it! Once the command above completes, you have all the software you
need to interact with this book.</p>
<p>You can now run the container with the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>docker run --rm -ti -p <span class="m">8888</span>:8888 -v <span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">PWD</span><span class="si">}</span>:/home/jovyan/work gdsbook/stack
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s unpack the command so we understand everything that is going on here to
get further insight into how the container works:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">docker</span> <span class="pre">run</span></code>: Docker does a lot of things, to communicate that we want to
<em>run</em> a new container, we need specify it.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--rm</span></code>: this flag will ensure the container is removed when you close
it. This in turn makes sure every time you run it again, you start
afresh with the exact same set up.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-ti</span></code>: this flag further ensures that the container is not run in the
background but in an _i_nteractive mode.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-p</span> <span class="pre">8888:8888</span></code>: with this, we ensure we forward the <em>port</em> from inside
the container out to the host machine (i.e. your laptop). This step is
crucial because it allows us to interact with the server
and for Jupyter to “send” JupyterLab across so we can access it in our
web browser.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-v</span> <span class="pre">${PWD}:/home/jovyan/work</span></code>: similarly, this flag “mounts” the folder
from where the command is being run in the terminal (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${PWD}</span></code>) into the
container so it is visible and editable from inside the container. Such
folder will be available at the container’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">work</span></code> folder.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gdsbook/stack</span></code>: finally, we also need to specify which image we want to
run. In this case, we run the image created for this book.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The command above will generate output that will look, more or less like the
following:</p>
