    "This chapter uses economic inequality to illustrate how the study of the evolution of social \n",
    "disparities can benefit from an explicitly spatial treatment.\n",
    "Social and economic inequality is often at the top of policy makers' agendas.\n",
    "Its study has always drawn considerable attention in academic circles.\n",
    "Much of the focus has been on *interpersonal income inequality*, yet there is a growing recognition\n",
    "that the question of *inter-regional income inequality* requires further \n",
    "attention as the growing gaps between poor and rich regions have been identified\n",
    "as key drivers of political polarization in developing and developed countries\n",
    "{cite}`Rodriguez_Pose_2018`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the study of inequalities has focused at the individual level: how do outcomes\n",
    "differ across individuals? This approach does not group individuals geographically. \n",
    "In other words, it is not concerned with whether those differences follow a pattern,\n",
    "for example, at the regional level (e.g. *is most of the more disadvantaged population\n",
    "located in a particular section of the map?*).\n",
    "Indeed, while the two literatures (personal and regional inequality) are\n",
    "related, they have developed in a largely parallel fashion with limited\n",
    "cross-fertilization. In this chapter, we examine how a spatially explicit focus\n",
    "can provide insights on the study of inequality and its dynamics. We hope this illustration\n",
    "can be useful in itself but also inspire the use of these methods in the study of\n",
    "other phenomena for which the regional perspective can bring value to the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "After discussing the data we employ, we begin with an introduction to classic methods for interpersonal income\n",
    "inequality analysis and how they have been adopted to the question of regional\n",
    "inequalities. These include a number of graphical tools along side familiar\n",
    "indices of inequality. As we discuss more fully, the use of these classical\n",
    "methods in spatially referenced data, while useful in providing insights on some\n",

    "A key point to keep in mind here is that the unit of measurement in this data is a spatial aggregate of individual incomes. Here, we are using the per-capita incomes for each county. By contrast, in the wider inequality literature, the observational unit is typically a household or individual. In the latter distributions, the degree of skewness is often more pronounced. This difference arises from the smoothing that is intrinsic to aggregation: the regional distributions are based on averages obtained from the individual distributions, and so the extremely high-income individuals are averaged with the rest of their county. The regional approach implies that, to avoid falling into the so-called \"ecological fallacy\", whereby individual conclusions are drawn from geographical aggregates, our conclusions will hold at the area level (the *county*) rather than the individual one (the *person*)."

    "The Gini index is a longstanding measure of inequality based on the notion of cumulative wealth distribution. To construct a Lorenz curve, the cumulative share of wealth is plotted against the share of the population that owns that wealth. For example, in an extremely unequal society where few people own nearly all the wealth, the Lorenz curve increases very slowly at first, then skyrockets once the wealthiest people are included. \n",

    "In contrast, a \"perfectly equal\" society would look like a straight line connecting $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$. This is called the *line of perfect equality*, and represents the case where $p$% of the population owns exactly $p$% of the wealth. For example, this might mean that 50% of the population earns exactly 50% of the income, or 90% of the population owns 90% of the wealth. The main idea is that the share of wealth or income is exactly proportional to the share of population that owns that wealth or earns that income, which occurs only when everyone has the same income or owns the same amount of wealth. \n",
    "\n",
    "With these notions in mind, we can define the Gini index as the ratio of the area between the line of perfect equality and the Lorenz curve for a given income or wealth distribution, standardized by the area under the line of perfect equality (which is always $\\frac{1}{2}$). Thus, the Gini index is a measure of the gap between a perfectly equal society and the observed society over every level of wealth/income. \n",

    "Several patterns emerge from the time series of Moran's I. Before delving into the details, it is worth noting that, while Gini and Theil follow a similar path, Moran's I displays a distinct trajectory. There is a long-term decline in the value of Moran's I. This suggests a gradual decline in the geographic structure of inequality with two implications: (a) per capita incomes are now less similar between nearby counties and (b), this has been consistently declining, regardless of whether inequality is high or low. \n",

    "### Regional Decomposition of Inequality\n",
    "\n",
    "One common objection to the analysis of inequality in aggregate relates to lack of detail about the scale at which inequality is most important. Inequality can be driven by differences between groups and not by discrepancies in income between similar individuals. That is, there is always the possibility that observed inequality can be \"explained\" by a confounding variate, such as age, sex, or education. For example, income differences between older and younger people can \"explain\" a large part of the societal inequality in wealth: older people have much longer to acquire experience, and thus are generally paid more for that experience. Younger people do not have as much experience, so young people (on average) have lower incomes than older people. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this issue, it is often useful to *decompose* inequality indices into constituent groups. This allows us to understand how much of inequality is driven by aggregate group differences and how much is driven by observation-level inequality. This also allows us to characterize how unequal each group is separately. In geographic applications, these groups are usually spatially defined, in that *regions* are contiguous geographic groups of observations. This section discusses regional inequality decompositions as a way to introduce geography into the study of inequality. \n",

    "Inequality is an important social phenomenon, and its geography is an important concern for social scientists. Geographical disparities in well-being have been pointed to as a major driver behind the rise of right-wing populist movements in the US and Europe {cite}`Rodriguez_Pose_2018`. Thus, understanding the nature of these disparities and their evolution is a challenge for both science and policy.\n",

    "This chapter discusses methods to assess inequality, as well as examine its spatial and regional structure. We have seen the Gini coefficient and Theil index as examples of global measures to summarize the overall level of inequality. As is often the case in many areas of spatial analysis, the straightforward adoption of methods from economics and sociology to spatial data can  often be fruitful but, at the same time, can miss key elements of the spatial story. In the context of spatial income disparities, we have highlighted the  differences between personal and regional inequality. From this vantage, we have reviewed three approaches to incorporate geography and space in the study of inequality. Together, this gives us a good sense of how inequality manifests geographically, and how it is (possibly) distinct from other kinds of spatial measures, such as those for spatial autocorrelation discussed in chapters [6](06_spatial_autocorrelation) and [7](07_local_autocorrelation). \n",
    "\n",
    "Before leaving the topic of spatial inequality, we note that there is much more that can be said about inequality and related concepts. Inequality is generally concerned with the static snapshot of the regional income distribution and the shares of that distribution that each region holds. Those shares are reflected in the variance or spread of the distribution. However, this is only one moment of the distribution, and a comprehensive understanding of disparities requires analysis of the distribution's location (mean) and shape (modes, kurtosis, skewness) as well as dispersion. Moreover, movements of individual regions within the distribution over time, or what is referred to as *spatial income mobility* are critical to our understanding of the dynamics of spatial disparities. Full consideration of these concepts is beyond the scope of this chapter. Interested readers are directed to {cite}`Rey2014` as an entry point to these more advanced topics.\n",
