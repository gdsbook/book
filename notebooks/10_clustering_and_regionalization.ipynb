    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The world's hardest questions are complex and multi-faceted.\n",
    "Effective methods to learn from data should recognize this. Many questions\n",
    "and challenges are inherently multidimensional; they are affected, shaped, and\n",
    "defined by many different components all acting simultaneously. In statistical\n",
    "terms, these processes are called *multivariate processes*, as opposed to \n",
    "*univariate processes*, where only a single variable acts at once.\n",
    "Clustering is a fundamental method of geographical analysis that draws insights\n",
    "from large, complex multivariate processes. It works by finding similarities among the\n",
    "many dimensions in a multivariate process, condensing them down into a simpler representation\n",
    "Thus, through clustering, a complex and difficult to understand process is recast into a simpler one\n",
    "that even non-technical audiences can look at and understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often, clustering involves sorting observations into groups. For these groups to be more\n",
    "meaningful than any single initial dimension, members of a group should be more\n",
    "similar to one another than they are to members of a different group.\n",
    "Each group is referred to as a *cluster* while the process of assigning\n",
    "objects to groups is known as *clustering*. If done well, these clusters can be\n",
    "characterized by their *profile*, a simple summary of what members of a group\n",
    "are like in terms of the original multivariate process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a good cluster is more\n",
    "similar internally than it is to any other cluster, these cluster-level profiles\n",
    "provide a convenient shorthand to describe the original complex multivariate process.\n",
    "Observations in one group may have consistently high \n",
    "scores on some traits but low scores on others. \n",
    "The analyst only needs to look at the profile of a cluster in order to get a\n",
    "good sense of what all the observations in that cluster are like, instead of\n",
    "having to consider all of the complexities of the original multivariate process at once. \n",
    "Throughout data science, and particularly in geographic data science, \n",
    "clustering is widely used to provide insights on the\n",
    "geographic structure of complex multivariate spatial data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of explicitly spatial questions, a related concept, the *region*,\n",
    "is also instrumental. A *region* is similar to a *cluster*, in the sense that\n",
    "all members of a region have been grouped together, and the region should provide \n",
    "a shorthand for the original data. \n",
    "Further, for a region to be analytically useful, its members also should\n",
    "display stronger similarity to each other than they do to the members of other regions. \n",
    "However, regions are more complex than clusters because they combine this\n",
    "similarity in profile with additional information about the geography of their members.\n",
    "In short, regions are like clusters (since they have a coherent profile), but they\n",
    "also have a coherent geography&mdash;members of a region should also be\n",
    "located near one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating regions is called regionalization.\n",
    "A regionalization is a special kind of clustering where the objective is \n",
    "to group observations which are similar in their statistical attributes,\n",
    "but also in their spatial location. In this sense, regionalization embeds the same\n",
    "logic as standard clustering techniques, but also applies a series of\n",
    "spatial and/or geographical constraints. Often, these\n",
    "constraints relate to connectivity: two candidates can only be grouped together in the\n",
    "same region if there exists a path from one member to another member\n",
    "that never leaves the region. These paths often model the spatial relationships\n",
    "in the data, such as contiguity or proximity. However, connectivity does not\n",
    "always need to hold for all regions, and in certain contexts it makes\n",
    "sense to relax connectivity or to impose different types of spatial constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we consider clustering techniques and regionalization methods which will\n",
    "allow us to do exactly that. In the process, we will explore the characteristics\n",
    "of neighborhoods in San Diego.\n",
    "We will extract common patterns from the\n",
    "cloud of multidimensional data that the Census Bureau produces about small areas\n",
    "through the American Community Survey. We begin with an exploration of the\n",
    "multivariate data about San Diego by suggesting some ways to examine the \n",
    "statistical and spatial distribution of the data before carrying out any\n",
    " clustering. Focusing on the individual variables, as well as their pairwise\n",
    "associations, can help guide the subsequent application of clusterings or regionalizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then consider geodemographic approaches to clustering&mdash;the application\n",
    "of multivariate clustering to spatially referenced demographic data.\n",
    "Two popular clustering algorithms are employed: k-means and Ward's hierarchical method.\n",
    "Mapping the spatial distribution of the resulting clusters \n",
    "reveals interesting insights on the socioeconomic structure of the San Diego\n",
    "metropolitan area. We also see that in many cases, clusters are spatially \n",
    "fragmented. That is, a cluster may actually consist of different areas that are not\n",
    "spatially connected. Indeed, some clusters will have their members strewn all over the map. \n",
    "This will illustrate why connectivity might be important when building insight\n",
    "about spatial data, since these clusters will not at all provide intelligible regions. \n",
    "So, we then will move on to regionalization, exploring different approaches that\n",
    "incorporate geographical constraints into the exploration of the social structure of San Diego.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",

    "These extremes are not very useful in themselves. But, in between, the hierarchy\n",

    "\n",
    "1) begin with everyone as part of its own cluster; \n",
    "2) find the two closest observations based on a distance metric (e.g. euclidean); \n",
    "3) join them into a new cluster; \n",
    "4) repeat steps 2) and 3) until reaching the degree of aggregation desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is thus called \"agglomerative\"\n",
    "because it starts with individual clusters and \"agglomerates\" them into fewer\n",

    "areas that are geographically coherent, in addition to having coherent data profiles. \n",
    "Effectively, this means that regionalization methods construct clusters that are \n",

    "Even though we have specified a spatial constraint, the constraint applies to the\n",
    "connectivity graph modeled by our weights matrix. Therefore, using k-nearest neighbors\n",
    "to constrain the agglomerative clustering may not result in regions that are connected\n",
    "according to a different connectivity rule, such as the queen contiguity rule used\n",
    "in the previous section. However, the regionalization here is fortuitous; even though\n",
    "we used the 4-nearest tracts to constrain connectivity, all but one of the clusters, \n",
    "cluster 4, is *also* connected according to our earlier queen contiguity rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, this may seem counter-intuitive. We did specify the spatial\n",
    "constraint, so our initial reaction is that the connectivity constraint is\n",
    "violated. However, this is not the case, since the constraint applies to the\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, clustering and regionalization are two complementary tools to reduce the\n",
    "complexity in multivariate data and build better understandings of the spatial structure \n",
    "of data. Often, there is simply too much data to examine every variables' map and its\n",
    "relation to all other variable maps. \n",
    "Thus, clustering reduces this complexity into a single conceptual shorthand by which \n",
    "people can easily describe complex and multifaceted data. \n",
    "Clustering constructs groups of observations (called *clusters*)\n",
    "with coherent *profiles*, or distinct and internally-consistent \n",
    "distributional/descriptive characteristics. \n",
    "These profiles are the conceptual shorthand, since members of each cluster should\n",
    "be more similar to the cluster at large than they are to any other cluster. \n",
    "Many different clustering methods exist; they differ on how the \"cluster at large\" \n",
    "is defined, and how \"similar\" members must be to clusters, or how these clusters\n",
    "are obtained.\n",
    "Regionalization is a special kind of clustering with an additional geographic requirement. \n",
    "Observations should be grouped so that each spatial cluster,\n",
    "or *region*, is spatially-coherent as well as data-coherent. \n",
    "Thus, regionalization is often concerned with connectivity in a contiguity \n",
    "graph for data collected in areas; this ensures that the regions that are identified\n",
    "are fully internally-connected. \n",
    "However, since many regionalization methods are defined for an arbitrary connectivity structure,\n",
    "these graphs can be constructed according to different rules as well, such as the k-nearest neighbor graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we discussed the conceptual basis for clustering and regionalization, \n",
    "as well showing why clustering is done. \n",
    "Further, we have shown how to build clusters using spatial data science packages, \n",
    "and how to interrogate the meaning of these clusters as well.\n",
    "More generally, clusters are often used in predictive and explanatory settings, \n",
    "in addition to being used for exploratory analysis in their own right.\n",
    "Clustering and regionalization are intimately related to the analysis of spatial autocorrelation as well,\n",
    "since the spatial structure and covariation in multivariate spatial data is what\n",
    "determines the spatial structure and data profile of discovered clusters or regions.\n",
    "Thus, clustering and regionalization are essential tools for the spatial data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What disciplines employ regionalization? Cite concrete examples for each discipline you list.\n",
    "2. Contrast and compare  the concepts of *clusters* and *regions*?\n",
    "3. In evaluating the quality of the solution to a regionalization problem, how might traditional measures of cluster evaluation be used? In what ways might those measures be limited and need expansion to consider the geographical dimensions of the problem?\n",
    "4. Discuss the implications for the processes of regionalization that follow from the number of *connected components* in the spatial weights matrix that would be used.\n",
    "5. True or false: The average silhouette score for a spatially constrained solution will be no larger than the average silhouette score for an unconstrained solution. Why, or why not? (add reference and  or explain silhouette)\n",
    "6. Consider two possible weights matrices for use in a spatially constrained clustering problem. Both form a single connected component for all the areal units. However, they differ in the sparsity of their adjacency graphs (think Rook being more dense than Queen graphs). \n",
    "    a. How might the sparsity of the weights matrix affect the quality of the clustering solution?\n",
    "    b. Using `pysal.lib.weights.higher_order`, construct a second-order adjacency matrix of the weights matrix used in this chapter. \n",
    "    c. Compare the `pct_nonzero` for both matrices. \n",
    "    d. Rerun the analysis from this chapter using this new second-order weights matrix. What changes? \n",
    "7. The idea of spatial dependence, that near things tend to be more related than distant things, is an extensively-studied property of spatial data. How might solutions to clustering and regionalization problems change if dependence is very strong and positive? very weak? very strong and negative? \n",
    "8. In other areas of spatial analysis, multilevel models [1] recognize that sometimes, geographical regions are more similar internally than they are externally. That is, two observations in the same region are probably more similar than two observations in different regions. If this kind of dependence is very strong, what would happen to clustering and regionalization solutions?\n",
    "9. Using a spatial weights object obtained as `w = pysal.lib.weights.lat2W(20,20)`, what are the number of unique ways to partition the graph into 20 clusters of 20 units each, subject to each cluster being a connected component? What are the unique number of possibilities for `w = pysal.lib.weights.lat2W(20,20, rook=False)` ?"
