    "In machine learning and data science, we are often equipped with *tons* of data. Indeed, given the constellation of packages to query data services, free and open source data sets, and the rapid and persistent collection of geographical data, there is simply too much data to even represent coherently in a single, tidy fashion. However, we often need to be able to construct useful *features* from this rich and deep sea of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where data is available, but not yet directly *usable*, *feature engineering* helps to construct useful data for modelling a given phenomenon of interest. In traditional machine learning, feature engineering involves applying additional *domain knowledge* to raw information in order to structure it in a manner that is meaningful for a model. Often, this involves some sort of *transformation* of the original dataset, which is a well-studied concept in both classical statistics and remains so in machine learning methods. While *feature engineering* always relies on this implicit domain knowledge, it is an extremely important part of adapting general-purpose algorithms to unique or distinctive problems facing the every-day data scientist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Geography is one of the most high-quality, ubiquitous ways to introduce *domain knowledge* into a problem: everything has a position in both *space* and *time*. And, while things that happen near to one another *in time* do not necessarily have a fundamental relationship, things that are *near* one another are often related. Thus, space is the ultimate *linkage key*, allowing us to connect different datasets together in order to improve our models and our predictions. This means that, even for *aspatial*, \"non-geographic\" data, you can use *spatial feature engineering* to create useful, highly-relevant features for your analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, *spatial feature engineering* is the process of developing additional information from raw data using *geographic knowledge*. This distilling of information can occur *between* datasets, where geography is used to link information in separate datasets together; or *within* datasets, where geography can be used to augment the information available for one sample by borrowing from nearby ones. This chapter is structured following that distinction: for cases where geography connects *different* datasets, we adopt the term \"Map Matching\", often used in industry; while we use the mirroring concept of \"Map Synthesis\" describing the use of geographical structure to derive new features from a given dataset. Technically speaking, some of the methods we review are similar across these two cases, or even the same; however they can be applied in the context of \"matching\" or \"synthesis\", and we consider those conceptually different, hence their inclusion in both sections. Throughout the chapter, we use the Airbnb nightly rental prices in San Diego, as well as auxilliary datasets such as elevation or Census demographics."

    "## What is spatial feature engineering? \n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, *spatial feature engineering* is the process of developing additional information from raw data using *geographic knowledge*. This synthesis could occur *between* datasets, where geography is used to link samples in separate datasets together; or *within* datasets, where geography can be used to borrow information from nearby samples. Building linkages *between* datasets is often called \"Map Matching\", while we use the term \"Map Synthesis\" to describe the use of geographical structure to derive new features from existing data. Both kinds of geographic feature engineering will be covered in this chapter, starting first with various methods for Map Matching when modelling Airbnb nightly rental prices in San Diego.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us discuss this, a vocabulary is helpful. We will cover a few different kinds of features in this chapter, both of which can be constructed in either Map Synthesis or Map Matching operations: \n",
    "- A *spatial summary feature* measures the attributes of observations that have some pre-specified spatial relationship with our target observations. This includes \n",
    "    - taking the average or median value of features within a neighborhood of each target observation. \n",
    "    - the *spatial lag*, used in previous chapters of this book (e.g. Chapters 3, 6, and 11), is a kind of spatial summary feature, since it reflects the average value of the data in the neighborhood around each point. \n",
    "    - Other kinds of spatial summary features might include the count of observations within a given distance or the standard deviation of ten nearest observations. \n",
    "    - Summary features generally include *interpolated features* which involve a transfer of information from one spatial support to another, such as when the target locations are not the same as the locations in our anciliary data. Interpolated features become significantly more complex as well when the data is *areal*, as will be discussed later in this chapter.\n",
    "- A *proximity feature* measures the distance from a target observation to some other observation or position in the map. This might be done in a map matching context, as we did before with the distance to Balboa Park, or it might be done in a map synthesis context by measuring the distance to the nearest other observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Engineering Using Map Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "Space is the ultimate linkage key; map matching is all about exploiting this asset. Geographic information is collected at different scales, aggregated using bespoke geographic delineations, and ultimately stored in different datasets. Modelling and machine learning usually require the use of data aligned and coherently structured; to bring disparate geo-datasets together, the data scientist needs to be able to transfer information expressed for one geography into another. This is where map matching comes to rescue. By using geographical location, we can connect datasets that have no common key or that are otherwise completely unrelated. This is a \"magic trick\" that we can pull off because of location that would be much harder, or impossible, with data of other nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details, and difficulty, of this transfer of information from one geography to another one depend on the nature of the \"source\" and \"target\", and on the precision with which we want to perform such transfer. In this context, there is always an inevitable trade-off between precission and sophistication: more precise transfer is usually possible at the expense of more advanced and involved techniques. Their additional cost in applying them, both in terms of cognitive load on the data scientist's part or in terms of computation, must be weighted in on an individual basis: sometimes we need the best possible estimates, at all costs; sometimes \"good enough\" is, well, good enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we cover a few cases that we consider represent the most common and widely used approaches. We begin with situations where we have two point datasets and all we need to calculate are descriptive statistics of one dataset to the observations in the other. We swith the type of data and consider how to attach information from a continuous grid, stored in a raster file, to a set of points. Then we show the equivalent case for \"moving\" information for a polygon geography to a point dataset. These are all cases that, in their simplest form, involve mostly traditional GIS operations (e.g. buffer construction, spatial joins) and little in the way of statistical modelling. As an example of a case that is more involved, we cover the transfer of information from a polygon geography to another, different polygon geography. For this final case, but also as a more general comment, we try to include examples that capture the essence of the method, but keep the technique as simple as possible. For almost any of these cases we cover, the reader can find more sophisticated techniques that usually yield more accurate estimates. Where possible, we try to signpost these.\n",

    "A first, conceptually straightforward, approach is to augment our dataset by counting how many points of a different dataset are in the vicinity of each observation.

    "Now, for some feature engineering, it may be extremely useful to know whether an Airbnb is located in a \"hot\" location, with a lot of restaurants and bars to choose from. Alternatively, if Airbnbs are very remote, they might not be as lucrative for short, expensive \"city-break\" reservations. That is, Airbnb users may decide to reserve stays where there are a lot of dining and drinking opportunities, and thus may be *willing to pay more* for the same accommodation. We might be able to predict prices better if we know about the drinking and dining scene near the Airbnb. \n",

This kind of \"feature counting\" is useful in applications where the mere presence of nearby features can affect the quantity we are modelling. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous example, we have transfered information from a surface (stored in a raster layer) to a set of points; in other words, we have gone from surface to points. Sometimes, however, we do not have the luxury of a ready-made surface. Instead, all we have available is a set of points with measurements for the variable of interest that do not match the points we want the information for. In this situation, a solution we can rely on is \"spatial interpolation\". For a continuous geographical field measured at a set of points, \"spatial interpolation\" methods provide us a way to guess at at the value a field would take at sites we do not measure. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many sophisticated methods with which this can be done. *Kriging*, common in the sub-field of spatial statistics called \"geostatistics,\" is one such practice based on the theory of *Gaussian Process Regression.* Another common approach, *geographically-weighted regression*, provides unique model estimates at every control point, as well as predictions for places where there is no data. Here, though, we'll use a very basic $k$-nearest neighbor prediction algorithm from `scikit-learn` to demonstrate the process. This process will select the nearest 10 listings, then compute the prediction using a weighted average of these nearest observations. To keep predictions relatively consistent, we will build an interpolation only for listings that are entire homes/apartments with two bedrooms:"

    "### Area to area interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "The final case of map matchin we consider is transfer of information from one polygon/areal geography to a different one. This is a common use-case when an analysis requires data that is provided at different levels of aggregation and different boundary delineations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a large literature around this problem under the umbrella of dasymetric mapping (REF). The conceptual idea is relatively straight-forward: we want to apportion values from one set of polygons to the other based on how much \"geography\" is shared. In its simplest case, we can do this based on area. In this case, we will assign values from the source geography to the target based on how much they share. Let us illustrate this with an example. We will call the geography for which we have data the \"source\", and that to which we want to transfer data the \"target\". If polygon A in the target is made up of 50% of polygon 1 in the source, 30% of polygon 2, and 20% of polygon 3, the estimate for A will be a weighted average between the values in 1, 2, and 3, where the weights are 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2, respectively. Of course, underlying this exercise is the implicit assumption that the values we are interested in are uniformly distributed within each polygon in the source and target. In some cases, this is a valid assumption or, at least, it does not introduce critical errors; in others, this is not acceptable. Dasymetric mapping has proposed a large amount of sophistications that try to come up with more realistic estimates and that can incorporate additional information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement dasymetric mapping in Python, the best option is `tobler`, a package from the PySAL federation designed exactly for this goal. We will show here the simplest case, that of areal interpolation where apportioning is estimated based on area, but the package provides also more sophisticated approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example, we need two polygon layers. We will stick with San Diego and use the set of Census Tracts and the [H3 hexagonal grid layer](../data/h3_grid/README.md). Our goal will be to create population estimates for each hexagon.\n",

And, with the wealth of freely available data from censuses, satellites, and open volunteered geographic information vendors such as OpenStreetMap, map matching can be a very powerful tool for enriching and improving your analyses. However, it is sometimes *also* useful to only examine the data you've got, and use the spatial structure within to build better features or better models. While this might be done using spatially-explicit models (like those covered in Chapter 11), it is also possible to use map synthesis to build spatial feature and improve your predictions.\n",
