  abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of spatial dynamics in the field of regional science. After defining the context of spatial dynamics and the alternative conceptualizations of space and time, the chapter surveys the various areas of substantive interest where spatial dynamics come to the fore. A second focus is on the methodological and technical issues surrounding the methods of space-time data analysis. Here the emphasis is on exploratory methods for space-time data focusing on the evolution of spatial patterns as well as the identification of temporal dynamics that cluster in space.},

The present chapter is devoted to considering the case in which the individual-process is constituted by non-modifiable individuals (see \textsection{} 2.3) instead of areas. We encounter this case when we study the individual behaviour of economic agents, such as families, firms, labour unions or governmental units, interacting in a study area. In particular the concern of this chapter is with the mechanism through which the individual agents' behaviour gives rise to spatial relationships.},
