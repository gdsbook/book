After defining the context of spatial dynamics and the alternative conceptualizations of space and time, the chapter surveys the various areas of substantive interest where spatial dynamics come to the fore. A second focus is on the methodological and technical issues surrounding the methods of space-time data analysis. Here the emphasis is on exploratory methods for space-time data focusing on the evolution of spatial patterns as well as the identification of temporal dynamics that cluster in space.},

It is argued that the inclusion of the spatial dimension in empirical analysis is still a rare practice in Mexico and even in international studies. Such inclusion allows studying the pattern of spatial interaction, the possible effects of spatial diffusion and the estimation of robust parameters. We apply the spatial data analysis methodology that has three components: (a) exploratory analysis, (b) visualization and (c) spatial econometric modeling. The main result suggests that technological innovation has a positive effect on Mexico’s regional economic growth. The empirical evidence also suggests that there is a positive effect coming from cross-border diffusion effects of technological knowledge. It also implies that states with stronger innovation activity benefited from spatial technological externalities and hence faster economic growth. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014},

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In ``The Future of Data Analysis,'' he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or ``data analysis.'' Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name ``data science'' for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of ``data science''programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M ``Data Science Initiative'' that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as ``cultural appropriation.'' This article reviews some ingredients of the current ``data science moment,'' including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for ``scaling up'' to ``big data.'' This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere ``scaling up,'' but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts fieldby-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are ``learning from data,'' and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today's data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals. Based on a presentation at the Tukey Centennial Workshop, Princeton, NJ, September 18, 2015.},

The results show that the level of interregional inequality has a positive and statistically significant effect on the incidence of civil conflict, which implies that countries with higher regional income disparities are more likely to experience internal violence. This result is not driven by a specific group of influential countries and is robust to the inclusion in the analysis of a substantial set of covariates that may affect both interregional inequality and civil conflict. Likewise, the observed link between regional income disparities and internal violence does not depend either on the estimation strategy or the measures used to quantify the degree of interregional inequality and the incidence of civil conflict within the various countries. These results suggest that policies designed to decrease the magnitude of regional income disparities may contribute to reducing the incidence of civil conflict.},

To this end, we apply inequality indices over regions to incidences, infection related mortality, and infection fatality rates. If avoiding of inequality in health is an important political goal, a metric must be implemented to track geographical inequality over time.                                         Methods               The relative and absolute Gini index as well as the Theil index are used to quantify inequality. Data are taken from international data bases. Absolute counts are transformed to rates adjusted for population size.                                         Results               Comparing continents, the absolute Gini index shows an unfavorable development in four continents since February 2020. In contrast, the relative Gini as well as the Theil index support the interpretation of less inequality between European countries compared to other continents. Infection fatality rates within the EU as well as within the U.S. express comparable improvement towards more equality (as measured by both Gini indices).                                         Conclusions               The use of inequality indices to monitor changes in geographic inequality over time for key health indicators is a valuable tool to inform public health policies. The absolute and relative Gini index behave complementary and should be reported simultaneously in order to gain a meta-perspective on very complex dynamics.},

abstract = {A recent review noted important differences in the results of the local Moran's statistic depending on the inference method. These differences had significant practical implications. In closing, the authors speculated the differences may be due to local spatial heterogeneity. In this article, we propose that different null hypotheses, not heteroskedasticity, generate these differences. To test this, we examine the null hypotheses implicit in common statistical significance tests of local Moranâ€™s . We design an experiment to assess the impact of local heterogeneity on tests conducted under the two most common null hypotheses. In this experiment, we analyze the relationship between measures of local variance, such as the local spatial heteroskedasticity (LOSH) statistic, and components of the local Moranâ€™s statistic. We run this experiment with controlled synthetic heteroskedastic data and with uncontrolled real-world data with varying degrees and patterns of local heteroskedasticity. We show that, in both situations, estimates that use the same null are extremely similar, regardless of estimation method. In contrast, all estimates (regardless of the null) are moderately affected by spatial heteroskedasticity. Ultimately, this article demonstrates that there are important conceptual and computational differences about null hypothesis in local testing frameworks, and these differences can have significant practical implications. Therefore, researchers must be aware as to how their choices may shape the observed spatial patterns.}

  abstract = {As the volume of digital data is growing exponentially and computational methods are advancing rapidly, network analysis is an increasingly important analytical tool to understand social life. This paper revisits the rich history of network analysis in geography and uses insights from that history to review contemporary computational social science. Based on that analysis, we synthesize the distinctive qualities of what we term geographical network analysis. Geographical network analysis presumes that networks are situated, construed through meaning, and reflect power relations. Instead of pursuing parsimonious explanations or universal theories, geographical network analysis strives to understand how uneven networks develop across space and within place through a constant back and forth between abstraction and contextualization. Drawing on the articles in this special issue, this paper illustrates how geographical network analysis can be put to work.},

  abstract = {Even though Gehlke and Biehl (1934) discovered certain aspects of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), the term MAUP was not coined formally until Openshaw and Taylor (1979) evaluated systematically the variability of correlation values when different boundaries systems were used in the analysis. The problem is called ``the modifiable areal unit'' because the boundaries of many geographical units are often demarcated artificially, and thus can be changed. For example, administrative boundaries, political districts, and census enumeration units are all subject to be redrawn. When data are gathered according to different boundary definitions, different data sets are generated. Analyzing these data sets will likely provide inconsistent results. This is the essence of the MAUP.},
