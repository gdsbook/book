  abstract = {Even though Gehlke and Biehl (1934) discovered certain aspects of the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), the term MAUP was not coined formally until Openshaw and Taylor (1979) evaluated systematically the variability of correlation values when different boundaries systems were used in the analysis. The problem is called ``the modifiable areal unit'' because the boundaries of many geographical units are often demarcated artificially, and thus can be changed. For example, administrative boundaries, political districts, and census enumeration units are all subject to be redrawn. When data are gathered according to different boundary definitions, different data sets are generated. Analyzing these data sets will likely provide inconsistent results. This is the essence of the MAUP.},

The results show that the level of interregional inequality has a positive and statistically significant effect on the incidence of civil conflict, which implies that countries with higher regional income disparities are more likely to experience internal violence. This result is not driven by a specific group of influential countries and is robust to the inclusion in the analysis of a substantial set of covariates that may affect both interregional inequality and civil conflict. Likewise, the observed link between regional income disparities and internal violence does not depend either on the estimation strategy or the measures used to quantify the degree of interregional inequality and the incidence of civil conflict within the various countries. These results suggest that policies designed to decrease the magnitude of regional income disparities may contribute to reducing the incidence of civil conflict.},

After defining the context of spatial dynamics and the alternative conceptualizations of space and time, the chapter surveys the various areas of substantive interest where spatial dynamics come to the fore. A second focus is on the methodological and technical issues surrounding the methods of space-time data analysis. Here the emphasis is on exploratory methods for space-time data focusing on the evolution of spatial patterns as well as the identification of temporal dynamics that cluster in space.},

  abstract={The aim of this investigation is to analyze the effect of technological innovation on Mexico’s regional economic growth during 1995–2007. It is argued that the inclusion of the spatial dimension in empirical analysis is still a rare practice in Mexico and even in international studies. Such inclusion allows studying the pattern of spatial interaction, the possible effects of spatial diffusion and the estimation of robust parameters. We apply the spatial data analysis methodology that has three components: (a) exploratory analysis, (b) visualization and (c) spatial econometric modeling. The main result suggests that technological innovation has a positive effect on Mexico’s regional economic growth. The empirical evidence also suggests that there is a positive effect coming from cross-border diffusion effects of technological knowledge. It also implies that states with stronger innovation activity benefited from spatial technological externalities and hence faster economic growth. Copyright Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014},
