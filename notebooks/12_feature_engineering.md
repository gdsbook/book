# Spatial feature engineering


Ways to "stick" space into models that are not necessarily spatial.

<!-- #region -->
**spatial feature engineering**: synthesizing information using spatial relationships either within the data or across data. 

This is one way of "spatializing" data that is included in models. This is not about fitting *spatial models* that use
> the kohonen quote about spatially-correlated learning in SOMs

it is about figuring out representations of geographical relationships and using them in typical non-spatial models.

## Feature Engineering Using Map Matching
*Using spatial relationships between two datasets to transfer information from one to another for a model.*
"Space is the ultimate linkage key." - DAB
### start by doing counting features on distanceband weights
### distance banding counts & distance-to a secondary feature
### Point Interpolation using sklearn (streetscore averaging from nearest sites)
### spatial join, but really don't focus too much on the structure/GIS theory of it
### tobler? area to area interpolation
### raster engineering to vector features


## Feature Engineering using Map Synthesis
*Using spatial relationships within a single dataset to synthesize new features for a model.*
### generalize distanceband/buffer counting into a re-explanation of WX models under different weights
### KNN-engineering, adding features by distances
### distance-banding
### eigenvectors feature engineering
### preclustering points into groups for group-based regressions
### use spatially-constrained clustering to build categorical variables for regression
